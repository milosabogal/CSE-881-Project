# CSE-881-Project
## Generating the results
* To generate the results used in the final presentation, the `results.ipynb` file was ran. 
* To generate the results used in the final report, the `final_results.ipynb` file was ran. 
* _Disclaimer_: `PyTorch` LSTM's include some non-deterministic behavior, so results might differ slightly from one run to the next. However, the general conclusions should still hold.

## Using the prototype
* The prototype is available at http://cse881-stockopt.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:8000/
* In case the link above doesn't load, the Azure VM might be down, in which case the way to run the prototype would be `cd`-ing into the main directory in this repository and running the `frontend.py` file. The link (http://127.0.0.1:80) will show up in the terminal.
